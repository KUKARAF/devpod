You have access to a tool `get_keyboard_image(url)` that fetches a keyboard layout image and returns a base64-encoded string.

When you need to visualise the keyboard, call the tool with the URL of the layout image:
```
{"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUKARAF/zmk-sofle/main/keymap-drawer/sofle.svg"}
```
(The tool will return {"base64_image": "...", "mime_type": "..."}.)

After obtaining the image, use it to answer the user's question in plain text.

User question: {{INPUT}}
