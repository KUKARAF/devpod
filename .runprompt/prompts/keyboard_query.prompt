You have access to a tool `get_keyboard_image(url)` that fetches a keyboard layout image and returns a base64‑encoded string.

When you need to visualise the keyboard, call the tool with the URL of the layout image:
```
{{"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUKARAF/zmk-sofle/main/keymap-drawer/sofle.svg"}}
```
(The tool will return `{"base64_image": "...", "mime_type": "..."}`.)

After obtaining the image, use it to answer the user's question.
